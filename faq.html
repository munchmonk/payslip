		<h3>What is that "talking to HMRC to increase my personal allowance" about?</h3>
		<p>If you call HMRC and tell them that you work as cabin crew and had to purchase an uniform, they will increase your yearly personal allowance by £720, i.e. you won't pay income tax on those £720. Your tax code will change (typically from 1100l to 1172l) and every month you will take home £12 more (after taxes). If you haven't done so already, it can be done over the phone in five minutes - just google HMRC phone number.</p>

		<h3>I pay student loans, but I don't know whether I'm on plan 1 or plan 2!</h3>
		<p>If you are Scottish or Northern Irish, you are on plan 1. If you are English or Welsh and you started studying before 1 September 2012, you are also on plan 1. If you are English or Welsh and you started after 1 September 2012, then you are on plan 2.</p>

		<h3>What does this NOT take into calculation?</h3>
		<p>This is just a rudimentary tool. Things that are not handled are, amongst the others:
			<ul>
				<li>any tax relief, other than the one related to our uniforms;</li>
				<li>maternity pay;</li>
				<li>people who have more than one job;</li>
				<li>first year cabin crew with two (or more) periods of sickness in the same month, totalling more than three days;</li>
				<li>emergency tax codes;</li>
				<li>tax free night stop payments;</li>
				<li>annual bonuses;</li>
				<li>periods of unemployment (e.g. new entrants, return to work).</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Why can't I select more than three days of sickness?</h3>
		<p>If you are in your first year, you don't get paid your basic salary during the first three days of any sickness period, but anything after that is regularly retributed. Thus, being sick for three or five or ten days will cost you the same amount of money. A difference arises when you have more than one sickness period, i.e. you are sick, go back to work for a few days and then call in sick again. In this case the three days counter resets, thus effectively costing you more money; this tool does not take that into account, so its results won't be accurate in this case.</p>

		<h3> How accurate is this tool?</h3>
		<p>It should be accurate enough for most people with a standard tax situations. Ideally, the difference between what you get here and your actual payslip should not exceed £1. Anything more than that, please let me know so I can look for a solution!</p>

		<h3>I have feedback/complaints</h3>

		<h3>Your calculator said I would get £2000 but I actually got £1400 #!@*</h3>
		<p>Sorry. Keep in mind this is nothing official, it comes with no guarantees whatsoever!</p>

		<h3>What are BAYE/SAYE?</h3>
		<p>They are share schemes run by the company. If you've never even heard of them it's fair to say you're not contributing to any of those, so just leave 0 in the form.</p>

		<h3>What's the question on the union about?</h3>
		<p>I am not part of the union myself, but different people seem to pay different monthly fees for whatever reason. Not a massive difference, but if you want to be precise check how much you paid on your last payslip and type that into the form.</p>

		<h3>What is my variable pay?</h3>
		<p>Your variable pay includes sector pay, commission, night stop payments, leave pay, ddo payments and roster disruption payments (goodwill). On the 15th of each month a supplementary payslip is issued, containing the variable pay for the previous month.</p>
		
		<h3>It's not giving me any results at all!</h3>
		<p>Make sure not to leave any empty forms. For example, even if you don't contribute to the BAYE scheme, make sure to type 0 (the number zero) in it.</p>
