		<h3>What does this NOT take into calculation?</h3>
		<p>This is just a rudimentary tool. Things that are not handled are, amongst the others:
			<ul>
				<li>any tax relief, other than the one related to our uniforms;</li>
				<li>maternity pay;</li>
				<li>people who have more than one job;</li>
				<li>first year cabin crew with two (or more) periods of sickness in the same month, totalling more than three days;</li>
				<li>emergency tax codes;</li>
				<li>tax free night stop payments;</li>
				<li>annual bonuses;</li>
				<li>periods of unemployment (e.g. new entrants, return to work).</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Why can't I select more than three days of sickness?</h3>
		<p>If you are in your first year, you don't get paid your basic salary during the first three days of any sickness period, but anything after that is regularly retributed. Thus, being sick for three or five or ten days will cost you the same amount of money. A difference arises when you have more than one sickness period, i.e. you are sick, go back to work for a few days and then call in sick again. In this case the three days counter resets, thus effectively costing you more money; this tool does not take that into account, so its results won't be accurate in this case.</p>

		<h3> How accurate is this tool?</h3>
		<p>It should be accurate enough for most people with a standard tax situations. Ideally, the difference between what you get here and your actual payslip should not exceed £1. Anything more than that, please let me know so I can look for a solution!</p>

		<h3>I have feedback/complaints</h3>
		<p>Please message me at http://facebook.com/zingus</p>

		<h3>Your calculator said I would get £2000 but I actually got £1400 #!@*</h3>
		<p>Sorry. Keep in mind this is nothing official, it comes with no guarantees whatsoever!</p>
		
		<h3>It's not giving me any results at all!</h3>
		<p>Make sure not to leave any empty forms. For example, even if you don't contribute to the BAYE scheme, make sure to type 0 (the number zero) in it.</p>

		<h3 id="variable">Where do I find out my variable pay?</h3>
		<p>On the 15th of each month we get a supplementary payslip containing the variable pay for the previous month. It's found where the normal payslip is, under workday, and all you have to do is write down the number at the bottom where it says "variable pay: taxable".</p>

		<h3 id="flexi">What are FLEXI benefits?</h3>
		<p>These are a number of different benefits that you can pay with part of your monthly gross pay, thus being tax efficient.</p>

		<h3 id="baye">What is BAYE?</h3>
		<p>The Buy As You Earn scheme allows you to use part of your gross monthly pay to purchase shares of the company with some additional benefits.</p>

		<h3 id="saye">What is SAYE?</h3>
		<p>The Save As You Earn scheme allows you to set apart some money from your net pay each month and, after certain a period, gives you the option to purchase shares of the company at a discounted price using the money you accumulated.</p>

		<h3 id="student">How do I find out which student loan repayment plan I am on?</h3>
		<p>If you are Scottish or Northern Irish, you are on Plan 1.<br>
			If you are English or Welsh and you started studying <i>before</i> 1st September 2012, you are on Plan 1.<br>
			If you are English or Welsh and you started studying <i>after</i> 1st September 2012, you are on Plan 2.</p>

		<h3 id="union">Are you part of the union?</h3>
		<p>Different people pay different monthly fees to the union for whatever reason. If you are part of it, keep in mind that the results are gonna be slightly off since the tool uses a ballpark figure of £16 which might be a little more or a little less than what you actually pay.</p>

		<h3 id="taxcode">What is this thing about updating the tax code?</h3>
		<p>Since we have to purchase an uniform at work, if you call HMRC and tell them they are gonna update your tax code - usually from 1100l to 1172l - which long story short ends up giving you an extra £12 per month in your net pay.</p>
